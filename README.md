# efyran

Efyran (*ee-fey-ran*) is a MacroQuest script written in Lua.

The main use for efyran is to simplify the playing of EverQuest with many characters at once.

It was created after playing with and modding the [E3 macro](https://github.com/cream24/Macros) over a number of years.

Some concepts are borrowed from E3, while others are new.
