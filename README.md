# efyran

The road to massive everquest botting.

[efyran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_route_E4) is a bot macro for Macroquest, written in Lua.

It was created after playing with and modding the older [E3 macro](https://github.com/cream24/Macros) over a number of years.

Some concepts are borrowed from E3, while others are new.
